    <h1>Welcome to the Exterior Cleaners App!</h1>
    <p>This app is designed to help exterior cleaners with quotations, measuring sizes of buildings, roofs, and managing the customer database.</p>
    <p>The app uses the Location API to estimate the address of the property and Google Maps API to view the property from above. The app also allows the user to enter the customer's details, and the entered data is turned into a printable report with other information specific to their business.</p>
    <p>The app could contain affiliate company links to buy products needed from companies providing a commission to us.</p>
    <p>The app could cost the user between £10 per month and £30 per month, depending on the tier level.</p>
    <p>The app will provide significant value to the user by reducing the time spent preparing quotes, optimizing the process, and saving potentially 20 hours or more per month.</p>
    <p>The target audience is exterior cleaners in the UK who can earn between £500 - £1000 per day.</p>
